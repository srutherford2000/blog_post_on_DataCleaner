## Intro:
This blog is a review of the [DataCleaner](https://datacleaner.github.io/) tool and its possible uses for MLOps. I found this tool to be easy to install and fairly helpful for creating a data pipeline. While I only used the GUI, there is also a CLI which could help in the automation of certain pipelines. Overall, I would recommend this tool for people who are trying to parse unstructured data, ensure columns meet specific criteria, and analyze trends. 

## How to Install:
Installing this tool was very easy. The steps are listed below:
1. Ensure your system has JRE installed
2. Download the latest version of DataCleaner from this [link](https://datacleaner.github.io/downloads.)
3. Unzip the download
4. Navigate into the folder that contains all of the java files
5. Launch DataCleaner by runnning the command <code>java jar .\DataCleaner.jar</code>

Note that the first time launching DataCleaner took a fairly long time (on the order of minutes) as it had to do some installation. After the first time, it loads quicker (on the order of seconds) using the same command.
